Annoyed Whale Game
======================

Play the game at http://andreakereliuk.com/annoyed-whale/

This is a fun little game to try to annoy a whale by poking its tail
(sorry, I know that rhymed).

The modules in whale.js allow the whale tail's scale, x-position, and 
wiggle to be customized in the index.html file.  The wave speed and scale
may also similarly be customized.

Annoyed Whale was created with the CreateJS library.
